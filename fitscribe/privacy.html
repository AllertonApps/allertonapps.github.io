      <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Allerton Apps, LLC (“Allerton Apps,” “we,” or “us”) handles information in the FitScribe mobile application (the “App”). We collect only what we need to provide a reliable training experience.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>FitScribe keeps your information minimal and purposeful. We never sell your data. We use it only to deliver personalized workouts, maintain your subscription, and troubleshoot issues.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>We collect account details from Apple (for example, a device identifier and purchase receipts), the workout logs you enter, and whether you have an active subscription. Optional diagnostics may include crash reports or basic performance metrics.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How We Use Data</h2>
        <p>Your data powers workout generation, syncs your entitlements, and helps us understand how features perform. We also use it to respond to support requests you send us.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Processing &amp; Storage</h2>
        <p>Allerton Apps processes data with reputable cloud providers that follow industry-standard security practices. Data may be stored in the United States or other regions where our infrastructure resides.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Sharing</h2>
        <p>We share data only with vendors who help us operate FitScribe, such as infrastructure providers, analytics tools, or Apple for subscription validation. These vendors must handle the data solely for the tasks we assign.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Analytics &amp; Ads</h2>
        <p>If we enable analytics or advertising features, we honor platform-level consent controls. You can opt out at the system level where supported, and we will respect those choices.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Choices</h2>
        <p>You can delete workout logs in the App at any time. Uninstalling the App removes local data from your device. Contact us at <a href="mailto:support@allertonapps.com">support@allertonapps.com</a> to request deletion of server-stored information or to ask about managing your subscription.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain data for as long as you maintain an account and for a reasonable period thereafter to comply with legal obligations or resolve disputes. When data is no longer needed, we delete or anonymize it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>FitScribe is not directed to children under 16. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe a child has provided data to us, please contact us so we can remove it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>International Transfers</h2>
        <p>If you access FitScribe outside the United States, your data may be transferred to the U.S. or other countries where we or our providers operate. We protect transfers using appropriate safeguards.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>We apply administrative, technical, and physical safeguards to protect the data we manage. Despite our efforts, no system is completely secure, so use the App with that understanding.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy to reflect new features or legal requirements. We will post the revised policy in the App or on our website with the updated date.</p>
      </section>
