      </p>
      <p>This Privacy Policy covers every current and future Allerton Apps game built with Unity (collectively, the “Games”). It explains how we handle advertising SDKs, consent dialogs, device identifiers, IP data, and your privacy choices. These Games are designed for players 13 and older.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>We monetize our Games through limited in-app purchases and advertising. Ads are served by Google AdMob and Unity Ads. We do not run separate analytics SDKs today; any telemetry comes from the ad providers or Apple’s built-in diagnostics that you have opted into. We do not sell your personal data.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data We Collect</h2>
        <p>Depending on your platform settings and consent choices, we may collect:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertising identifiers such as IDFA and IDFV (iOS) for ad delivery, personalization, and fraud prevention.</li>
          <li>Coarse device information (model, OS version, language, screen size) and app version to keep the Game running smoothly.</li>
          <li>IP address and derived approximate location (country/region) so ad providers can comply with regional rules and detect abuse.</li>
          <li>In-app events (level completions, rewarded placement triggers) only as needed to decide when to show an ad or unlock a reward.</li>
          <li>Crash reports or aggregated diagnostics when you choose to share them with Apple or Google.</li>
        </ul>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>We use the information above to deliver personalized and non-personalized ads, frequency cap impressions, detect invalid traffic, process optional purchases, maintain security, and comply with platform requirements. Aggregated, de-identified data may be used to understand feature performance and prioritize updates.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Ads, Consent &amp; Analytics</h2>
        <p>Each Game implements Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) prompt and Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) where required. Personalized ads only run if you grant consent. If you decline, you will still see contextual (non-personalized) ads that rely on limited data such as coarse location and content metadata. We do not embed third-party analytics libraries today; if that changes, this page will describe them.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We share personal data only with:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Advertising platforms (AdMob, Unity Ads) that deliver ads, measure performance, and prevent fraud.</li>
          <li>Cloud or platform vendors that host leaderboards, crash logs, or purchase receipts.</li>
          <li>Legal authorities when required to comply with law or defend our rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We require partners to use the data solely for the services they provide to us.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Retention &amp; Security</h2>
        <p>Ad identifiers and log data are kept only while needed for ad delivery, auditing, or legal obligations. Aggregated metrics may be retained longer without identifying you. We apply administrative and technical safeguards, but no mobile service can guarantee absolute security.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Children</h2>
        <p>The Games are not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children. If you believe a child has provided data, email <a href="mailto:support@allertonapps.com">support@allertonapps.com</a> so we can delete it.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Your Rights &amp; Choices</h2>
        <p>Depending on where you live, you may have rights to access, correct, delete, or restrict the processing of your data, or to object to certain processing:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>GDPR / UK GDPR:</strong> Residents of the EU/EEA or UK can email us to exercise data subject rights. We may request verification.</li>
          <li><strong>CCPA / CPRA:</strong> California residents may request access or deletion and may opt out of “selling” or “sharing” personal information. Because we only work with ad networks as service providers, opting out effectively means disabling personalized ads, which you can do via the in-app consent controls or platform settings.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Send requests to <a href="mailto:support@allertonapps.com">support@allertonapps.com</a>. We will respond consistent with applicable laws.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Change Consent / Privacy Options</h2>
        <p>You can reopen the consent dialog (Google UMP) from any Game’s settings screen by selecting <em>Privacy Options</em>. That screen lets you switch between personalized and non-personalized ads or withdraw consent entirely. To change ATT decisions, go to iOS <strong>Settings &gt; Privacy &amp; Security &gt; Tracking</strong> and toggle tracking access for the Game.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Contact</h2>
        <p>Email <a href="mailto:support@allertonapps.com">support@allertonapps.com</a> for privacy questions, requests, or complaints. If we cannot resolve an issue, you may have the right to contact your local data protection authority.</p>
