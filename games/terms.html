      <p>These Terms of Use and End User License Agreement (“Terms”) govern your use of every Allerton Apps mobile game (the “Games”). By installing or playing any Game you agree to these Terms, Apple’s Licensed Application End User License Agreement (if you obtained the Game through the App Store), and any applicable platform rules. If you disagree, uninstall the Game and do not use it.</p>

      <section>
        <h2>License Grant</h2>
        <p>Subject to these Terms, Allerton Apps grants you a personal, non-exclusive, non-transferable, revocable license to download and use the Games on devices you own or control and solely for your personal entertainment. We retain all rights not expressly granted.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>User Conduct &amp; Restrictions</h2>
        <p>You agree not to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy, modify, reverse engineer, decompile, disassemble, or derive source code from any Game except where permitted by law.</li>
          <li>Bypass security measures, cheat, exploit bugs, or use unauthorized automation.</li>
          <li>Upload or transmit viruses, malware, or any malicious code.</li>
          <li>Use the Games for commercial purposes, public performances, or gambling.</li>
          <li>Harass other players, post unlawful content, or infringe intellectual property rights.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Failure to comply may result in suspension or termination of access.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>In-App Purchases &amp; Ownership</h2>
        <p>Some Games offer optional in-app purchases (“IAPs”), including non-consumable unlocks or consumable items. IAP transactions are processed by the platform provider (Apple) and subject to their payment terms. All prices and availability are subject to change. Purchases grant you a limited license to access the applicable digital content within the Game; they do not transfer ownership. All sales are final except where platform refund policies apply.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Advertising &amp; Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>The Games may display ads or offer rewarded content from third parties such as Google AdMob or Unity Ads. We do not control the content of third-party ads. Your interactions with third parties are solely between you and the provider, and may be subject to additional terms.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Updates &amp; Availability</h2>
        <p>We may add, modify, or remove features without notice. We are not obligated to maintain any specific feature set or to make the Games available at all times. We reserve the right to discontinue a Game or limit access to certain regions or devices.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Disclaimer of Warranties</h2>
        <p>The Games are provided “as is” and “as available” without warranties of any kind, whether express or implied, including warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, non-infringement, or uninterrupted availability. Your use is at your own risk.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, Allerton Apps and its affiliates shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or for any loss of profits, data, or goodwill, arising from or related to the Games. Our total liability for any claim will not exceed the amount you paid (if any) for the specific Game during the twelve months preceding the claim. Some jurisdictions do not allow these limitations, so they may not apply to you.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Termination</h2>
        <p>We may suspend or terminate access to any Game at any time if we believe you violated these Terms or if we discontinue the Game. You may terminate these Terms by deleting the Game and discontinuing use. Upon termination, the license granted to you ends immediately.</p>
      </section>

        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>These Terms are governed by the laws of the State of Florida, USA, without regard to conflict-of-law principles, except where local law requires otherwise. You agree to the exclusive jurisdiction of state and federal courts located in Hillsborough County, Florida (greater Tampa area) for disputes arising out of these Terms or the Games, and you waive any objection to venue in those courts.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Changes to These Terms</h2>
        <p>We may update these Terms to reflect new features, legal requirements, or business practices. We will post the updated Terms with the new effective date. Continued use of any Game after changes become effective constitutes acceptance.</p>
